COVER LETTER GENERATOR

DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple python script I made to help me create cover letters without
having to copy and paste a bunch of things over and over and potentially adding the wrong info. 

INSTALLATION AND RUNNING:
Requires: python3
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Format your template to your liking (see below)
3. Open a new powershell window in the projects directory
4. Run the script with 'python makecoverletter.py'
5. Enter your job-specific details

USAGE:
You can fill your template out however you like but the following items are what I fill in with 
specific details about the job:

TODAY : current date of the form Day Month Year (e.g. 4 July 1776)
SOURCE : where I found the job (e.g. LinkedIn)
GENERICTITLE : a generic title for the position (e.g. software engineer)
JOBTITLE : Title of the specific job I am applying for (e.g. New Grad Software Engineer- Linux Kernel)
COMPANY : the company I am applying to work for
ADJ : an adjective used to describe the kind of work I might be doing (e.g. meaningful, timely)
TEAM : the name of the team/department the position belongs to
FIELD : the field of work the job is in (e.g. software engineering) 

Each of these items can be replaced as needed to fit whatever your cover letter looks like.
I hope this makes your job hunt just a little bit easier :)
